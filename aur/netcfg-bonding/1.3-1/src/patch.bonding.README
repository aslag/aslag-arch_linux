The file "patch.bonding" is a patch for the file src/bonding in the AUR package
netcfg-bonding 1.3-1 (cf. https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=25771). 

The patch fixes a script name change introduced in netcfg 2.8.2-1 that breaks
the bonding script.

Apply patch by extracting the netcfg-bonding package, copying patch.bonding
to src/, and executing "patch <patch.bonding".

netcfg-bonding is GPL and so is patch.bonding; see COPYING for license text.
